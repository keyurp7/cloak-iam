# IAM Specialist Portfolio Website

This is a fast, responsive, and accessible single-page portfolio template tailored for an Identity & Access Management specialist.

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder:
  - Python: `python3 -m http.server 5173`
  - Node (if installed): `npx serve .`

## Customize

1. Replace placeholders in `index.html`:
   - "Your Name", email, links, and section content
   - Update case studies, experience bullets, skills, and certifications
2. Add your resume file as `resume.pdf` in this folder (or adjust the link)
3. Optional: swap the color theme in `styles.css` by adjusting CSS variables

## Structure

- `index.html`: Content and sections
- `styles.css`: Theme, layout, and responsive styles (light/dark supported)
- `script.js`: Theme persistence, mobile nav, and small UX enhancements

## Deploy

- GitHub Pages: push this folder to a repo and enable Pages (root or `/docs`)
- Netlify/Vercel: drag-and-drop or connect the repo; no build step required

## Notes

- The contact form uses `mailto:` as a simple fallback; integrate a form backend (e.g., Netlify Forms) for production use.
