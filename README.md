# CLOAK: Enterprise Continuous Least-Privilege IAM Platform

[![Build Status](https://github.com/<ORG>/cloak-iam/actions/workflows/expanded_build_release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<ORG>/cloak-iam/actions/workflows/expanded_build_release.yml)

## Overview

CLOAK is a next-generation, enterprise-grade Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform designed for continuous least-privilege enforcement, seamless integration across hybrid environments (cloud and on-premises), and rigorous compliance adherence.

Built with security-first principles, CLOAK enables organizations to:

- Automate fine-grained privilege management and dynamic access control  
- Enforce identity lifecycle management with minimal attack surface  
- Integrate privileged access management (PAM) and identity federation  
- Deliver end-to-end supply chain provenance and secure deployment  
- Provide rich auditing, monitoring, and compliance reporting

## Features

- Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)  
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access policies  
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) with just-in-time access  
- Identity federation with SAML, OIDC, and OAuth2  
- Automated user provisioning, de-provisioning, and access reviews  
- Comprehensive logging, alerting, and audit trails  
- Scalable microservices architecture with Docker and Kubernetes support  
- Secure CI/CD pipeline with SBOM, SLSA/in-toto provenance, and code signing  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose  
- Kubernetes cluster (optional for cloud/on-prem deployment)  
- Python 3.11+ (for backend development)  
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn (for frontend development)  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/<ORG>/cloak-iam.git
   cd cloak-iam
   \`\`\`

2. Backend setup:  
   \`\`\`bash
   cd services/backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   \`\`\`

3. Frontend setup:  
   \`\`\`bash
   cd ../../services/frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   \`\`\`

4. Deploy with Docker Compose:  
   \`\`\`bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   \`\`\`

### Configuration

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for environment variables and secrets management.

## CI/CD and Security

- GitHub Actions workflows are located in \`.github/workflows/\`.  
- Build, test, security scanning, packaging, and release pipelines are fully automated.  
- Supply chain security is implemented via SLSA/in-toto and SBOM generation.  
- Code signing is enabled for Windows installers.

## Repository Secrets Setup

To enable full CI/CD functionality, create the following secrets in GitHub repository settings (\`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions\`):

| Secret Name           | Description                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| \`WINDOWS_CERT_PFX\`     | Base64-encoded Windows code signing PFX certificate |
| \`WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD\`| Password for the PFX certificate                      |
| \`RELEASE_UPLOAD_TOKEN\` | Token for external artifact repository (optional)    |
| \`SLSA_SIGNING_KEY\`     | Key for supply chain provenance signing (optional)   |
| \`VAULT_TOKEN\`          | Token to access secrets during runtime (optional)    |

## Branch Protection & Workflow Policies

- Protect \`main\` branch with required status checks:  
  - \`Build, SLSA Provenance, Sign & Release\`  
  - \`Security Scans (SAST & DAST)\`  
- Require pull request reviews before merging  
- Enable GitHub Actions workflow permissions only for authorized users  
- Use environment protection rules for manual approval on signing jobs
